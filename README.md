# MeeseeksSVN
An command fulfiller for SVN projects in sublime.

## About
This is my first sublime plugin so I went with something that several others have already done. Thanks to those that have paved the way with excellent examples to teach me a few things.

Specific kudos to:
* [VCS Gutter](https://github.com/bradsokol/VcsGutter/blob/master/vcs_gutter.py) for images and relating API calls
* [HypnotoadSVN](https://github.com/m-hall/HypnotoadSVN) for Sublime API examples and code structure

## Installing
Clone the repo into your 'Packages' directory under Sublime Text 3 app data.

## Using
Just right click or use the shortcut to get a status report of the project or diff a file/folder. The gutter will update on saving a file. For now updating on modification slows down the editor quite noticably.
